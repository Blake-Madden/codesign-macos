# Codesign macOS application with CMake

This project illustrates how we could codesign a macOS application with CMake.

In this project will try to codesign a basic CLI application written in C++.

## Requirements

- CMake
- Xcode

I use a `Makefile` for convenience.

## Codesign the application

Build, codesign and run your application:

```sh
TEAM_ID=<YOUR TEAM-ID> make
```

For example if your certificate is: `Developer ID Application: JOHN, DOE (X4MF6H9XZ6)`.

You will use in this way:
```sh
TEAM_ID=X4MF6H9XZ6 make
```

> Note: If you use an "Apple Development" certificate, You'll have to go to the "Keychain Access"
> and look at the "Get Info" menu, then you'll get the "Organisational Unit" that you'll use.

ðŸŽ‰ The cli app is codesigned! The codesign part is done by CMake,
but if you are curious, you can see the command in the logs:

```text
CodeSign .../codesign-macos/dist/Debug/MyCLIApp (in target 'MyCLIApp' from project 'MyCLIApp')
    cd .../codesign-macos

    Signing Identity:     <YOUR CERTIFICATE>

   <THE COMMAND>
```

> Note: The CLI binary is available at `./dist/Debug/MyCLIApp`

## Check codesign

The codesign verification is already done while running `make`, but 
you can use the following commands to check that the binary is properly codesigned.

### `codesign --verify`

```sh
$ codesign --verify --verbose=2 ./dist/Debug/MyCLIApp
```

> Note: that is the one I used in the Makefile

You should see something like:

```text
./dist/Debug/MyCLIApp: valid on disk
./dist/Debug/MyCLIApp: satisfies its Designated Requirement
```

### `codesign --display`

This command will show more information about the signature.

```sh
$ codesign --display --verbose=2 ./dist/Debug/MyCLIApp
```

You should check in the console and see something like:

```text
Authority=Developer ID Application: <YOUR NAME> (<TEAM-ID>)
```
